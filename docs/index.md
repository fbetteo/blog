# AI Engineering & Consulting

I'm an AI engineer, sr. data scientist, and consultant specializing in production-ready machine learning systems. With extensive experience designing and implementing AI solutions for CPG and retail businesses, I help organizations build scalable, efficient, and reliable AI systems that deliver measurable ROI.

I write about life, AI - machine learning - statistics, building a business as indiehacker and of course, sports analytics.

## About me

I've been there, I've worked with massive amounts of data, felt the pain of long pipelines that end up not working. I've seen that data not matching between reports, I've seen it duplicated in a side project, I've seen the wrong numbers in a coworker's customer facing powerpoint.

I've built prediction models, I've deployed them, I've created AI agents and RAG applications and I know, because of experience, where the problems and uncertainties might appear, and I can help you be prepared for that.

### My approach: Building AI systems you can actually control

**Measurable over mysterious** - Turn your "black box" AI into systems you can debug, measure, and improve. No more guessing why things break or hoping they work.

**Hands-on, not hands-off** - I build alongside your team with your data, your codebase, your specific problems. You get working solutions, not just recommendations.

**Team empowerment over dependency** - The goal is making your team self-sufficient. You learn the systematic approaches that let you maintain and improve AI systems long after our engagement ends.

When leadership asks "What's our AI strategy?" or "Why did this fail?" - you'll have clear answers backed by data, not excuses.

### YouChatChannel - Applied AI Engineering in Action

I'm the founder of [YouChatChannel](https://youchatchannel.com), an AI platform that allows you to have interactive conversations with YouTube channels through advanced AI assistants.

YouChatChannel transforms passive content consumption into an engaging, interactive experience. The platform analyzes video content through transcripts and creates specialized AI assistants (LLMs) that can answer questions, explain concepts, and provide insights based on the channel's content.

This project exemplifies how I approach AI engineering challenges: building systems that deliver real value while maintaining technical excellence behind the scenes.

### E-commerce Image Similarity Engine: From Concept to Conversion

**Business Problem:** A major e-commerce retailer struggled with product discovery across their catalog of thousands of items, limiting cross-selling opportunities.

**My Engineering Solution:** I engineered a complete visual similarity system using a proven 3-step methodology:
1. Efficient image acquisition pipeline handling thousands of product images
2. Optimized embedding generation with CLIP/ResNet models for maximum accuracy
3. High-performance similarity search using FAISS vector indexing.

**Business Impact:** Inmediately customer support was able to offer similar products to customers reaching out, generating new sales or speeding up the customer support response time and reducing tedious work.  
Next application will be to compare current products with new catalogs from suppliers to identify valuable opportunities.

[Read this blogpost](/writing/posts/image-similarity-ecommerce/) to see how  this inmediate high ROI problem was solved.  
Or check the [portfolio example](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fbetteo/fashion_similarity.)  
**Could your business benefit from similar AI-powered product discovery?** [Schedule a consultation](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ0JQSYOeX4y5slQlDYH66ugJq05Yx9Mj2gwfAOam5kfXNTRJZIZZUuJoHT-BsbKS-HgIM7M67ij?gv=true) to discuss your specific needs.


### Sportsjobs Online
I run a [job board for sports analytics](https://sportsjobs.online) and data related positions. This includes working for teams, consultancy companies, whole leagues and some esports or betting organizations.  

This is a project I handle myself, all self hosted and that I'm growing from a personal perspective. Finding sports analytics opportunities is not easy and I have a business running 24/7 which is something I encourage anyone to try.
