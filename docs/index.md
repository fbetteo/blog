# Hey

I'm a consultant, sr. data scientist / machine learning engineer, solopreneur and AI generalist. I've vast experience in CPG and retailers including demand estimation,  price elasticity, marketing mix and assortment solutions. I have also worked in the airline industry, I've been a teacher and I have passion for sports analytics. 

I write about life, AI - machine learning - statistics, building a business as indiehacker and of course, sports analytics. 

## Independent Consulting

I run a solo consulting practice focused on helping startups build better practises relative to machine learning implementation as many software companies transition to AI. 
Also I can help preparing educational material ad hoc.

Some clients: [Diggity](https://es.linkedin.com/company/digitty), [Oxford University](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/ai_ml/index.html)  and working directly with a few CPG startups.


## Sportsjobs Online
I run a [job board for sports analytics](https://sportsjobs.online) and data related positions. This includes working for teams, consultancy companies, whole leagues and some esports or betting organizations.  

This is a project I handle myself, all self hosted and that I'm growing from a personal perspective. Finding sports analytics opportunities is not easy and I have a business running 24/7 which is something I encourage anyone to try.
