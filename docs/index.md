### YouChatChannel - Applied AI Engineering in Action

I'm the founder of [YouChatChannel](https://youchatchannel.com), an AI platform that allows you to have interactive conversations with YouTube channels through advanced AI assistants.

YouChatChannel transforms passive content consumption into an engaging, interactive experience. The platform analyzes video content through transcripts and creates specialized AI assistants (LLMs) that can answer questions, explain concepts, and provide insights based on the channel's content.

This project exemplifies how I approach AI engineering challenges: building systems that deliver real value while maintaining technical excellence behind the scenes.

### E-commerce Image Similarity Engine: From Concept to Conversion

**Business Problem:** A major e-commerce retailer struggled with product discovery across their catalog of thousands of items, limiting cross-selling opportunities.

**My Engineering Solution:** I engineered a complete visual similarity system using a proven 3-step methodology:
1. Efficient image acquisition pipeline handling thousands of product images
2. Optimized embedding generation with CLIP/ResNet models for maximum accuracy
3. High-performance similarity search using FAISS vector indexing

**Business Impact:** Inmediately customer support was able to offer similar products to customers reaching out, generating new sales or speeding up the customer support response time and reducing tedious work.  
Next application will be to compare current products with new catalogs from suppliers to identify valuable opportunities.

[Read this blogpost](/writing/posts/image-similarity-ecommerce/) to see how  this inmediate high ROI problem was solved.  
**Could your business benefit from similar AI-powered product discovery?** [Schedule a consultation](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ0JQSYOeX4y5slQlDYH66ugJq05Yx9Mj2gwfAOam5kfXNTRJZIZZUuJoHT-BsbKS-HgIM7M67ij?gv=true) to discuss your specific needs.


### Sportsjobs Online
I run a [job board for sports analytics](https://sportsjobs.online) and data related positions. This includes working for teams, consultancy companies, whole leagues and some esports or betting organizations.  

This is a project I handle myself, all self hosted and that I'm growing from a personal perspective. Finding sports analytics opportunities is not easy and I have a business running 24/7 which is something I encourage anyone to try.
