# Obisidan Workflow

This is my first personal order for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with some actual rules and not improvising everything.

I've read [Kepano's way](https://stephango.com/vault) and [this other guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSTy_BInQs8.) I think both are useful in some way but I' sticking closer to Kepano. Not copying as he has a lots of templates with structured information in the YAML as he seems to create a lot of lists and rankings. Currently I'm using Obsidian a lot for technical notes, daily notes, paper annotation but also some listing as books I've read, movies, etc. It's a mix and I'm not sure I know what info to put for everything that is not a book, or game. Like, notes from some technical topic I can put the area or the author but there is no ranking.

Also, I like folders and he hates them.
I'll do the following.

* Have folders by general topic to order the notes (book, movies,  companies I work for, projects). Notes will be written where they belong the most. For general technical topics (such as Xgboost, I might create a data science or technical folder with all there. I'll put reasonable tags, many notes in different folders might share tags)
* Notes across folders might share useful information. Maybe I have some deployment technical note on a company that could apply for another project, or even I'll want to find it without remembering where I applied it, so, I'll also add **tags** so I can see everything together using [dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
* I'll try to add relevant information usable by dataview in some cases, such as Author for books, or technical notes.
* I'll have a [[tags]] folder with relevant tags with queries from dataview so I can have stuff organized.
* I'll keep tags in english for technical stuff but for books, series, etc where is more natural to remember in spanish (I'm from Argentina) and won't be shared probably I'll ues them in spanish (such as "policial", "novela", etc which are words that I never use in english).
