# My words, sometimes technical, sometimes not

I previously had a [blog](https://fbetteo.netlify.app) where I used to write about technical topics in english or spanish (lately only english). Here you can find all that old content and anything new that I publish, this is the actual **source of truth**.

You can expect to find topics around statistics, AI, machine learning, learning to do business or software in general but also about myself.
