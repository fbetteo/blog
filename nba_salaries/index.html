        <p>Are NBA players paid according to their observable contribution to winning games?
          Who are the most underpaid players? Who are the most overpaid? Which variables are
          useful to explain differences in salaries?</p>
        <p>To answer these questions we need:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><b>Data.</b>
              We retreived salaries data from
              <a href="https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w29-historical-nba-team-spending-against-the-cap">
              data.world</a>.
              Personal stats were obtained from
              <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats">
              Kaggle</a>.
              We scraped relevant events &mdash;injuries, fines, sanctions and personal issues&mdash; from
              <a href="http://www.prosportstransactions.com/basketball">
              Pro Sports Transactions</a>.
              We only kept records between seasons between 2008 and 2018 for players
              with an annual salary over 1 million dollars and more than 400 minutes
              played each season.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>A statistical model.</b>
              To understand how personal stats and events determine salaries we fitted a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model">
              Generalised Additive Model</a> (GAM).
              As opposed to standard linear regression, GAMs allow us to estimate non-linear
              effects between the target and each feature, whilst preserving additivity and
              thus interpretability.
              In our model salaries we use annual salaries as the target variable &mdash;
              to make them comparable over the years we adjust them with the
              <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/9">
              Federal Reserve CPI</a>
              so that they are held at constant 2018 dollars.
              Salaries are explained by a set of 20 predictor variables, made up of
              by-season game stats and historical events.

        <h3>The most important variables behind salaries</h3>
          <p>This kind of modelling enables us to discover why some players make more money
            than others &mdash;or in other words, how players' observable features determine their
            salaries. Below we can see the shape of the effects of the statistically most
            important features, represented as a green line. Behind the line we plot the
            confidence band &mdash;the wider the band, the less confidence we can have in
            that the fitted effect is correct.</p>
          <p>For example, in the plot for Age we find that, holding all other features fixed,
            salary tends to increase at ages around 28-30, while it is lower for
            the very young and the very old &mdash;which is quite reasonable.</p>

        <h3>Overpayment and underpayment</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p> Given the fitted impact of the predictor variables on salaries
           we can estimate the expected salary for each player each season.
           This allows us to give an estimate of residuals &mdash;that is, the
           difference between the expected salary and the actual salary.
           By inspecting residuals we can identify which players get payments way
           different from what the model suggests.
           Some of them have been overpaid, getting much more money than the expected
           according to what they did on the court and their personal features.
           On the other hand, some players contributed a lot more to their teams
           than what they got paid for.
